Hi,

I've recently read your blog post [1] and would like to
thank you for all the years of hard work you've put into
maintaining GTK+ on Windows. The things we've been doing
with PyGTK on Windows recently (even if it's a project slated
for deprecation) would simply not have been possible
without it!

It is mainly with the PyGTK-2.24+friends release (and possible
future bugfix releases) for Windows in mind that I'm contacting
you. These Python bindings packages have (as far as I'm aware)
always depended on the GTK+ Windows stack provided on [2] and
after discussing the situation with my PyGTK co-maintainer
(John Stowers) we'd really like to continue to do so (for
GTK+-2.24.X/PyGTK-2.24.X only) and only start investigating the
packages on openSUSE's Build Service for future
GTK+-3/PyGObject/gobject-introspection Windows builds.

Would you be willing to share your complete build environment/scripts
you've created over the years used to build the packages and gtk+-bundle
as they are currently available on [2] so we can continue supporting
the 2.24 cycle on Windows?

Thanks,
Dieter Verfaillie
