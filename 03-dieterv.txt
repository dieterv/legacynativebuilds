Thanks! Had a list of questions, but managed to answer most myself
by reading the packages' build scripts.

Yes OBS is amazing, but we feel it would be too much of a change on
such short notice (PyGTK 2.24 windows binaries are ready, if tests
go well they'll be released today/tomorrow). That and users will
be nagging us for the gtk+-2.24 bundle ;)

The good news is that we'll have more than enough time to investigate
OBS for the next generation of Python bindings. Started work on
porting gobject-instrospection (needed by PyGObject), but it's going
slow (there's only so many hours a day). Even found your patch on
bugzilla. Thanks for that, it sure is helpful!

Is it OK if I document your build environment on live.gnome.org?
Something like a GTK+/Win32/LegacyNativeBuilds? Also, what (if any)
license is to be attached to your scripts?

Thanks,
Dieter
