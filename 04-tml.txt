Sure, that would be very nice.

Oh,  I could just place them in the public domain. Except that such a
concept has no legal meaning in many countries, including mine, I
think. What is the shortest but also very permissible Open Source
license?  MIT/X11? Even that is longer, word-count-wise, than the
shell scripts...

Let's do it formally, I hereby allow you to publish them freely if you
attach the following license blurb to them, hmm except pkg-config.sh,
which I think Owen Taylor posted in a mail a long time ago.
